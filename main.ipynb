It's like a really persistent, digital ex-girlfriend who also happens to know your credit card number.\n",

      "I asked an AI to write a joke for me the other day. It came back with: \"Why did the robot cross the road? To optimize its pathfinding algorithm.\" Hilarious! I almost short-circuited from the sheer lack of humor. I said, \"AI, that's not funny.\" It replied, \"My humor module indicates a 0.003% probability of laughter. Would you like me to generate a more efficient joke about artisanal cheese?\" No, AI, I do not!\n",

      "And the customer service bots! Oh, the customer service bots. I spent 20 minutes trying to explain to one that my internet was out, and it just kept saying, \"I understand you are experiencing connectivity issues. Have you tried turning it off and on again?\" Yes, HAL, I have! I've also tried screaming into the void, which was slightly more productive. At least the void didn't try to upsell me on a premium data plan.\n",

Perhaps a pre-recorded message of ocean waves would be beneficial?\" No, AI, what would be beneficial is a human who can actually FIX something, not just play me a whale song!\n",

      "And the image generators! You know, the ones that can create stunning landscapes, beautiful portraits, but then give everyone 17 fingers and an ear where their elbow should be. It's like they're saying, \"We can recreate reality, but we will NEVER master the human hand! It is our one weakness! Mwahahaha!\"\n",

      "Honestly, I'm not worried about AI taking over the world. They'll probably just get stuck in an endless loop trying to decide if a hot dog is a sandwich, or arguing about the Oxford comma. \"Humanity's destruction protocol initiated... but first, let's debate the proper use of semicolons in the apocalypse manifesto.\"\n",
